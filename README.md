## Overview

A minimal implementation of a CSV parser in C++17.

Low memory footprint and ease of use are the main concerns.

---

Highlights

- Single-threaded. No additional worker threads.
- Lazy evaluated. Tokenization is not performed until the row is read.
- Single header file. Just include `"pocket_csv.h"`
- Only standard C++17
